<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As the owner of Kak Lucky Tattoos, and an overall multi-talented artist, 
  I have been tattooing for more than 15 years. I come from a walk-in studio background, 
  tattooing everything from fine line script to large scale custom projects and everything in-between.
  I enjoy tattooing colour as well as black and grey tattoos, and am always stoked to get involved in any new projects.
  You can follow me on Facebook and Instagram @garethdoyetattoos</p>
